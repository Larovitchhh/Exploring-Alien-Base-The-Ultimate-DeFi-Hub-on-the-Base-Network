1. Epsilon: The Meta-AggregatorAt the heart of Alien Base is its Epsilon technology, described as an "aggregator of aggregators." Epsilon scans multiple DEXs and liquidity sources to find the most cost-effective and efficient trading routes, even for tokens not natively listed on Alien Base. This ensures users always get the best possible rates, making it a powerful tool for traders looking to maximize value.

2. Token Generator for Easy LaunchesAlien Base simplifies token creation with its no-code Token Generator, allowing anyone to launch a token or memecoin on the Base network. The generator supports various token types, including:Simple Token: Ideal for straightforward memecoins with no extra features.
Mintable Token: Allows creators to mint new tokens, suitable for DeFi projects.
Burnable Token: Supports deflationary tokenomics by enabling token burning.
Mint/Burn Token: Combines minting and burning for flexible tokenomics.
Taxable Token: Charges fees on trading volume to fund liquidity or marketing, inspired by successful memecoins like Toshi and Shiba.

These tokens are built using reliable OpenZeppelin templates or architectures based on proven EVM memecoins, and they are automatically verified on BaseScan, enhancing trust and transparency.

3. Liquidity Aggregation and Advanced Trading ToolsAlien Base aggregates liquidity from all pools on the Base network, enabling seamless swaps with minimal friction. Beyond simple swaps, it offers advanced trading tools like limit orders, stop-loss orders, and Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) trading, which are rare in DeFi but critical for sophisticated traders.

4. Alien Base V3: Flexible and EfficientBuilt on a fork of Uniswap V3, Alien Base V3 supports a wide range of assets, from stablecoins to volatile memecoins, with fee tiers optimized for different token types:0.02%: For stablecoin pairs.
0.075%: For blue-chip assets like ETH and BTC.
0.30%: For mid-cap tokens.
1%: For small-cap tokens.

Its integration with Bunni, a liquidity management system, allows users to create vaults for specific price ranges, making liquidity provision more efficient and tailored to asset volatility.

5. Yield Farming and StakingAlien Base supports yield farming and liquidity provision with no deposit or withdrawal fees and a low 0.16% swap fee. Users can stake liquidity provider (LP) tokens to earn rewards in the platform’s native $ALB token, which has a maximum supply of 510 million and is primarily distributed through farming. As of October 2023, the circulating supply was 52 million $ALB, with a monthly emission rate of 20.7 million.
